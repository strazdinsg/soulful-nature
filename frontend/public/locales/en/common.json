At that time, I held a leadership role in a high-pressure industry where the expectations were relentless. On the outside, I appeared strong. On the inside, I was burning out.",
          "A visit to my doctor confirmed what I already knew: burnout. I was given two choices — take a long sick leave, or make a significant change. I chose change.",
          "I have always loved working, solving challenges, and leading with a strategic mindset. But I realized that to continue in leadership, I needed a new approach — one that would not only restore my energy but also make my performance sustainable."

For some, it was sounds that stirred emotions and memories; for me, it was images and impressions that surfaced, offering new perspective. That moment became the true beginning of my cacao journey."

When I join a Cacao mindfulness practice, the atmosphere helps me relax and quiet my thoughts almost instantly. I settle into a calm state of being present, here and now. Along the way, I often experience meaningful visions and insights that support me both personally and professionally.

No matter what stage of life you’re in, where you come from, or what your current state of mind is, we can all benefit from a moment of reflection and a deep breath. Here, you have the opportunity to experience exactly that.\nInguna is deeply passionate about her work. She creates a space of safety and invites you on an inner adventure without judgment or rush. What you gain from the circle is entirely up to you: maybe you simply need rest and reassurance, maybe you want to look at stresses in your life from a new perspective, or maybe you just want to be around open-minded people. Who knows 🙂\nAnd yes— the cacao is delicious and of exceptionally good quality!",
