At that time, I held a leadership role in a high-pressure industry where the expectations were relentless. On the outside, I appeared strong. On the inside, I was burning out.",
          "A visit to my doctor confirmed what I already knew: burnout. I was given two choices — take a long sick leave, or make a significant change. I chose change.",
          "I have always loved working, solving challenges, and leading with a strategic mindset. But I realized that to continue in leadership, I needed a new approach — one that would not only restore my energy but also make my performance sustainable."

For some, it was sounds that stirred emotions and memories; for me, it was images and impressions that surfaced, offering new perspective. That moment became the true beginning of my cacao journey."
